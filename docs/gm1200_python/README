1. Introduction
===============

This package contains source code which documents :

  * The SB9600/SBEP protocols as seen in a GM1200. This information was 
    obtained through watching the activities on the wire with a serial port and
    an oscilloscope.

    - Note, these protocols may be patented by Motorola. Use is entirely at
      your own risk!

  * A GM-1200 controller library. There is much much more to do here!

2. Usage example (Python 3)
